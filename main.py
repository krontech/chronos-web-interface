"""Web server proxying the chronos internal D-Bus API.
	
	This web server exposes the video and control APIs for the
	Chronos 1.4 High-Speed Camera, as well as a web app to make use
	of them.
	
	To enable the API and app, on your camera, navigate to the App &
	Internet screen via the Preferences & Utilities screen. Enter a
	password or click the ðŸŽ² button to generate a secure random
	password. After this is done, you should see an App URL in the
	newly- appeared right column. This is the URL you can access the
	API as well as the web app at â€“ `/app/*` serves the app and
	`/api/*` serves the APIs.
	
	This server is intended to be launched either via `utils/watch-
	camera`, for debugging, or simply via `python3 main.py`. It will
	need to be restarted if certain HTTP options change, such as port
	number to serve on. The server will read these configurations from
	the API on startup, but it will not restart itself if they change.
	
	As with all files in this project, this file is licenced under the
	GNU General Public Licence. See licence.txt for details/copyright.
	
Examples:
	Shell HTTP:
		curl 'http://192.168.1.135/api/0.1.0/get?\["totalAvailableFrames"\]' \
		-H 'Cookie: password=e929eb14dda6dc481466fec08eda49836c0982a939b7e44a2fc5665013c5627a'
	
	JS HTTP: (Run in a browser dev console, after logging in to the app.)
		fetch("http://192.168.1.135/api/0.1.0/set", {
			"credentials": "include", 
			"headers": { "content-type": "application/json; charset=utf-8"},
			"referrer": "http://192.168.1.135/", 
			"referrerPolicy": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", 
			"body": '[{"playbackFrame": 5000}]', 
			"method": "POST", 
			"mode": "cors"
		})
		.then(resp => resp.json())
		.then(error => console.info('set error', error)) //> set error null
	Web URL:
