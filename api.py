"""Python client library for Chronos D-Bus API.

	This module provides a convenient wrapper around the D-Bus API,
	abstracting away some of the more verbose parts of connecting
	and commanding the camera. It wraps two interfaces, "control"
	and "video".

	Usage:
	import api
	print(api.control('get_video_settings'))

One frame (at 60fps) should be plenty of time for the API to respond, and also quick enough that we'll notice any slowness. The mock replies to messages in under 1ms, so I'm not too worried here.

class CallbackNotSilenced(Exception):
	"""Raised when the API is passed an unsilenced callback for an event.
	
		It's important to silence events (with `@silenceCallbacks`) on Qt elements
		because they'll update the API with their changes otherwise. If more than
		one value is being processed by the API at the same time, it can cause an
		infinite loop where each value changes the element and the element emits
		another change event.
		
		This is explicitly checked because having an unsilenced element emit an
		update will usually work. The update will (asychronously) wind its way
		through the system, and when it gets back to updating the emitting element
		the element will have the same value and will not emit another update.
		However, if the element has a different value, then it will change back.
		The update for the change will be in flight by this time, and the two will
		enter an infinite loop of updating the element as they fight. Any further
		changes made to the element will now emit more update events which will
		themselves loop. Since this is very hard to detect reliably in testing,
		we force at least the consideration of silencing elements on the callback,
		since it makes it much easier to track down an issue by reading the
		callback and making sure it silences the elements it changes. We can't
		reasonably test if it silences the right elements unfortunately. This
		could be solved by not emitting events to the client which initiated them,
		but while fairly trivial with the socket.io websocket library, it seems
		very difficult or impossible with d-bus.
		
		Note: It is helpful to have events propagate back to the python UI
		however. It means we can ignore updating other elements when changing
		one element, since - as either element could be updated at any time
		from (say) a web ui, it doesn't really matter where the update originates
		from. All that matters is that it does update.

def observe(name: str, callback: Callable[[Any], None], saftyCheckForSilencedWidgets=True) -> None:
	"""Observe changes in a state value.
	
		Args:
			name: ID of the state variable. "exposure", "focusPeakingColor", etc.
			callback: Function called when the state updates and upon subscription.
				Called with one parameter, the new value. Called when registered
				and when the value updates.
			isNonUpdatingCallback=False: Indicates no API requests will be made from
				this function. This is usually false, because most callbacks *do*
				cause updates to the API, and it's really hard to detect this. A
				silenced callback does not update anything, since it should silence
				all the affected fields via the @silenceCallbacks(â€¦) decorator.
		
		Note: Some frequently updated values (> 10/sec) are only available via
			polling due to flooding concerns. They can not be observed, as they're
			assumed to *always* be changed. See the API docs for more details.
		
		
		Rationale:
		It is convenient and less error-prone if we only have one callback that
		handles the initialization and update of values. The API provides separate
		initialization and update methods, so we'll store the initialization and
		use it to perform the initial call to the observe() callback.
		
		In addition, this means we only have to query the initial state once,
		retrieving a blob of all the data available, rather than retrieving each
		key one syscall at a time as we instantiate each Qt control.
