# Chronos Web Interface

Web App and HTTP API for the Chronos 1.4 high speed camera, from [Kron Technologies, inc.](https://krontech.ca).

Currently in development against the mock D-Bus API. As such, it does not work. And, as it is in early development, it does not provide a stable API to develop against.
