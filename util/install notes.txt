On the Chronos, run the following to set up for this project, after setting up gui2:

> mkdir ~/web
> cd ~/web
> apt install python3-aiohttp

Then, deploy & run the app. You can do this by copying or
by running ~`util/watch-computer.sh`, if your ssh config
is set up so you can `ssh cam` and get to the camera.
